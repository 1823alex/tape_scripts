# tape_scripts

Just a collection of a few WIP bash scripts I use for my own tar tape backups on linux. 

Planning to further integrate automatic tape changes for multivolume tape archives written in larger tape libraries like HP/Sun SL48 MSL4048 or Dell PowerVault 124T depending on which library stays.

## Working Scripts:
simpleMultiTapeList.sh

simplebackup.sh

simplerestore.sh

## Prerequisites:
Packages:

mt-st

mbuffer

tar
